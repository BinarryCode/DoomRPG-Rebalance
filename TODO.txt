TODO:
- Re-ID every item into a higher range (31000 perhaps?)
- Add learned exotic assembly effects to Password System when using DRLA
- Health Regen Station in the Outpost clears 1% Toxicity every charge

Bugs:
- Multiplayer Player health bars are not showing the fills of the proper players

Launcher:
- Make sure to force the branch text to "master" just to make sure it stays on it
- Load Order System

Rewrites:
- Health Bar Script, needs to be properly redone and seperated into multiple functions
- Input Checking, should be re-written to use the generic CheckInput() method
- Shields, should just be rewritten to not suck in general
- Item and Monster Databases, for mod compatibility and allowing the creation of seperate patches outside the main library
- Locker, seperated into it's own file and split handling into functions and less repeated code
- Password System, re-write to use one hex string instead of 40+ CVARs, also rename it since Password isn't accurate anymore
? Replace "Static" address space with a new DRPGStatic address space which references a different array
? Allow LibDS to exist outside of DRPG rather than statically compiling it (requires new address space, see above)
