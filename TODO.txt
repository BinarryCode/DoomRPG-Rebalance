Doom RPG
- Re-ID every item into a higher range (31000 perhaps?)
- DRLA Sets involving weapons can bug out if you deposit them in the Locker
- Practice target is broken AGAIN
- Add more pages to Stats menu
  -> Perks page, listing the perks for each stat
  -> Team page, listing basic info/stats of other players
- Make the scaling multiplier for skill costs adjustable by the player instead of just the skill level
