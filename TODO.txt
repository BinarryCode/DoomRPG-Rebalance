General
- Re-ID every item into a higher range (31000 perhaps?)
  - You can now ID stuff in MAPINFO, which would be a much better option to keep everything together and organized
- Go through and properly credit EVERYTHING (god that'll take a while)
- Item Roulette has a weird bug with EnterOutpost, likely corruption somewhere? (WHY WON'T ENTEROUTPOST JUST DIE FJELFHWIUGHUIWG)
- Character save checksumming is horribly broken for god knows what reason
- Rewards list needs to be generated per-game, not per-map
- Co-op PIP is still not working properly
- Do some extra distance checks for FOV zoom for the faked 3D health bars? (bug SidDoyle about it, he likes mathy things)
- Add handling for negative XP and Rank gain (killing marines/turrets in the Outpost)
- Customizable shop special
  - Min/Max Price Range
  - Cycle Time
  - Discount

DRLA
- Technician buffs
  - Hacking cursor is slower (-1) in the crate hacking minigame
  - Gets a discount on turret upgrade purchases?

Potential Future Stuff
- Add a ticker/notice display for different events (shop special item changes, rolling events, reinforcement spawns, etc)
- Add different backpacks for different things (medical backpack, bullet/shell/rocket/cell specific backpacks, stim backpack, etc)?
- New Armor System
  - Crafted either in a new menu or in a specific place in the Outpost
  - 4 Components
    - Material - Determines the durability
    - Reinforcement - Determines the damage absorption
    - Coating - Adds additional resistances to damage types
    - Tech - Passive bonuses which the armor can give (No radius damage, etc)

Minigames
  - Item Roulette
    - Allow variable amount of chips to be used to
      - Adjust the amount of items in the roulette
      - Reduce chances of duds
      - Item Quality
  - Slot Machine
  - Blackjack
  - Hacking

Map Events System
  - Create a more generic reward system for completing events
  - Allow you to pick up the nuke when it's disarmed and drop it again for maximum room clearing boom

Portable Turret System
  - Enemies with the same TID need special complicated magichandling to work properly and not confuse the turrets
  - Empty crates should be omitted from the crate sensor beam iteration
    - Add a FindCrate() function which takes a TID and returns the found crate with that TID to help with this
  - Command Modules
  - There should probably maybe possibly be a range limit for the item scanning,
    since it can take a good minute to iterate through the sheer amount of items
    in a big map.
    - Make this into a CVAR?

Starting Options
  - Selecting Any for either DRLA armor or boots causes a runaway
  - Exotic Modpacks are getting added even without the option on
  - Having higher starting Credits should not trigger Luck XP gain

Launcher
- Load Order System
- Add new classes for Beta 8

Rewrites/Reorganization
- GDCC, Rewrite the codebase to use the GDCC compiler (RIP me)
- GUI System, Finish the GUI library and move all menu and related things to using it
- Input Checking, should be re-written to use the generic CheckInput() method
- More utility function for repetitive menial shit (InMenu(), etc)
? Databases, for mod compatibility and allowing the creation of separate patches outside the main library
