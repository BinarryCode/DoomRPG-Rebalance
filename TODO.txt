Doom RPG
- Animate items in inventory bar
- Add dynlights for DRLA:MP projectiles
- Externalize Transport voting into a Vote(str message) function (not sure how to actually accomplish this properly in ACS/DS)
- Hacky magnetize idea: when active and enemies die, pass DropItem() the TID of the killing player so the item just drops at their feet instead of the monsters
- show player name in transport vote message (%N with print and PlayerNumber())
- Show a player's stats when you target them

Doom RPG Launcher
- Allow multiple folders for WAD/PK3 scanning, recursively scan as well?
