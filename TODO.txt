Doom RPG Launcher
- Allow multiple folders for WAD/PK3 scanning, recursively scan as well?
- Save-game parsing for information and loading
- Populate the IWAD box based on which IWADs you actually have
- Add a check to make sure the Launcher isn't in the chosen Doom RPG folder so it doesn't try to delete itself
