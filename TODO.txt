Doom RPG
- Shield causing you to randomly fall over and die?
- Nuclear set bonus bug with Locker?
- Divide-by-zero in Loop script, no way to reproduce yet
- Passwords seem to be breaking a bit; Level jump occured as well as Aug Upgrades being read as Aug Canisters
- Tweak the Vitality Max Health formula to do what it should (10x health at 1000 Vitality with a steady progression)
- Ammo boxes dropped from enemies are making generic pickup sounds

Re-DECORATE-ing
- Re-ID every item into a higher range (31000 perhaps?)
