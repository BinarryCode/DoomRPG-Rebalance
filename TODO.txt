General
- Re-ID every item into a higher range (31000 perhaps?)
  - You can now ID stuff in MAPINFO, which would be a much better option to keep everything together and organized
- Go through and properly credit EVERYTHING (god that'll take a while)
- Co-op PIP is still not working properly
- Do some extra distance checks for FOV zoom for the faked 3D health bars? (bug SidDoyle about it, he likes mathy things)
- Make BBS use page switching behavior similar to Shop, switching pages to switch mission difficulty, try to keep a consistant input style for all the menus
- Add more CVARs to customize the loot generator (how it calculates max items in particular, player level, player luck, map number, combinations, etc)
- Sinstorm's demon spawn cubes spawn monsters inside of walls and each other, which frankly looks silly as hell

Conversion bugs
- Try and get through a megawad without encountering problems

Post-Conversion/1.0?
- Double-check all DRLA icons, sprites, info and etc in the ItemData
- Add Utility skills similar to DRLA's skulls
  - Ditto for recall phase device
- Add a DRLA only corrupted player event, fuck you die
- Increment the charsave version since we'll need to make quite a few modifications to it for GDCC
  - Also double-check that all DRLA assembly tokens are actually saved
- Yholl's Shield Redux 3.0
  - Add new bodies, batteries and capacitors
  - Add visual effects for the shield (pulsating dynamic light, blue-aura style circle things?, etc)
  - Add Delay Rate as a stat to the menus so you can actually see it
- Shield Accessory->Augs Revamp
  - Either remove shield accessories or rename them into something else which further modifies shield stats
  - Completely rewrite the Augmentation system to support categories, multiple enabled effects, and easier to handle/read battery usage
    - Remove the current HUD widget and move its info up into the Credits/Module widget, since they will play a much more active part in-game, the battery should be visible at all times with effects active
  - Revamp and recategorize all the accessory effects into their own categories (Yholl offered to do this)
  - Make the effects more generic and not just tailored to shields (Yholl offered to do this)
  - Upgrading effects will have different benefits depending on the effect type
    - Static effects offer a few levels and change fairly drastically between upgrades
    - Scaled effects have a max level of 100 and scale their bonus slowly
    - Optimized effects have 10? levels which decrease the battery usage, but don't modify the effect at all
  - Upgrade canisters will either be scrapped or repurposed
  - Slot upgrades can only be used on a single category, which will increase the maximum effects you can have active in the specified category by 1
  - Unlocking and upgrading augs will now require a canister and a specific amount of modules
  - Some effects will only discharge battery when used or triggered, while others discharge passively while active
- Investigate why Demon Artifacts decide to take a siesta and magically dissapear off of guns
  - Seems to be an issue with character saving/loading
- Investigate the Death's Gazes artifact stunning power pissing off marines and other Outpost appliances when it's already got a check not to
- Add immunity to megabosses from the Death's Gaze death stunlock
- Get new sounds to replace a crapload of the old placeholders
  - Many skills are placeholders (Heal, Auras, etc)
  - Menu sounds are from Doom 3 and are getting real old now
    - Considering switching them to Perfect Dark sounds instead for when the GUI gets worked on
  - Individual pickup and use sounds for each health item
  - Maybe the armor types too?
  - Status effect hit and avoid sounds are just shit
  - Extra Life pickup and use sounds
- Add ambient stingers for when the music is off, just to fuck with you :D
- DRLA ammo counters for synthfire weapons are reversed on the HUD
- Turret stuff
  - Revamp overheat system's numbers for the addition of upgrades for it
  - Add a beam/team skill to slowly clean Toxicity from the player
- Tips browser (after GUI rewrite)
- Furious Fusion stops working every time you sell a weapon?
- Startup options are broken to shit and back for some reason
- Add strength scaling options to try and mitigate the hardcoded damage formula issues
- Add dodging and sprinting system
- Generic reward system that everything can use (Rank payout rewrite, etc)
- Barrels
  - Elemental Barrels (yoink from DRLA?)
  - Soul Capsules (rare capsules with souls in them you can break to acquire?)
- Brightmaps
  - Low Power Generator
  - Turret part crate?
  - UAC supply crate?
- DRLA HUD needs it's drawing order revised to make sure nothing is overlapping with each other
- Re-check all default settings, see how they feel, etc
- Bulk withdrawal on the weapons page with DRLA needs an extra check to prevent torgue-tier explosions from happening (runaway scripts)
- The old negative regen XP bug is back
- Add a tip that describes the shield name colors
- Controller friendliness, simplify the control scheme
  - Loaded stims could (and probably should) be inventory items like everything else - using it asks if you want to use it, drop it, or scrap it, default being use
  - Skill Wheel and Turret Wheel need to be analog-controllable (see input checking at the bottom)
- For Stat Randomization, disable manual stat increases, and give the player a fixed number of stat points for every level-up
- Turn pickup healing items into a WoA style portable replenishable medkit item instead of carrying fifteen billion healing items all the time
- More easter eggs :D

Payout System
- Remove current payout system and replace with a new one:
  - Perform all kinds of different actions to earn PP (Payout Points)
  - Different options for triggering, such as time limit or level end, etc
  - In the new Payout menu, you can choose what kinds of things you'd like to use your PP on
    - XP
    - Rank
    - Credits
    - Modules
    - Turret Parts
    - Aug Set
    - Stim Packages
    - etc

Potential Future Stuff
- Add a ticker/notice display for different events (shop special item changes, rolling events, reinforcement spawns, etc)
- Add different backpacks for different things (medical backpack, bullet/shell/rocket/cell specific backpacks, stim backpack, etc)?
- Rework the way auras drop items; in particular, use the Inventory Transfer flag to make enemies drop backpacks
- New Armor System
  - Crafted either in a new menu or in a specific place in the Outpost
  - 4 Components
    - Material - Determines the durability and base damage absorption
    - Reinforcement - Adds bonus damage absorption
    - Coating - Adds additional resistances to damage types
    - Tech - Passive bonuses which the armor can give (No radius damage, etc)

Minigames
- Slot Machine
  - Kate wants to do this
- Blackjack

Portable Turret System
- Empty crates should be omitted from the crate sensor beam iteration
  - Add a FindCrate() function which takes a TID and returns the found crate with that TID to help with this
- [KS] Pathfinding

Launcher
- Load Order System

Rewrites/Reorganization
- GUI System, Finish the GUI library and move all menu and related things to using it
- Input Checking, should be re-written to use the generic CheckInput() method
- More utility function for repetitive menial shit (InMenu(), etc)
- Arena System to support seperate arena maps and their own self-contained scripting
? Databases, for mod compatibility and allowing the creation of separate patches outside the main library
