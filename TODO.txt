Doom RPG
- Shield causing you to randomly fall over and die?
- Nuclear set bonus bug with Locker?
- Divide-by-zero in Loop script, no way to reproduce yet
- Tweak the Vitality Max Health formula to do what it should (10x health at 1000 Vitality with a steady progression)
- Monster threat calculations should check the actor string for Nightmare, Cybernetic or Armageddon and apply extra threat appropriately, also add extra threat if the BOSS flag is present
- Move DoomRL data changes in CheckSkills() into BuildSkillData()

Re-DECORATE-ing
- Re-ID every item into a higher range (31000 perhaps?)
