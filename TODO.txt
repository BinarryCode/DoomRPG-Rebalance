TODO:
- Update DRLA stuff for DRLA Beta 8/Monster Pack Beta 5
- Re-ID every item into a higher range (31000 perhaps?)
- Add learned exotic assembly effects to Password System when using DRLA
- Shop and Locker systems need to handle set bonuses properly, specifically in a called function
- Portable Turret System
  - Seperate level and stats system
  - Create upgrade items
  - Give different Upgrade items to boost it's stats
  - Different upgrade items to change it's attack type maybe
  - Make stats persistent between levels
  - Menu with pages for Stats, Upgrades, etc
  - Battery powered, you need to either give it Augmentation batteries or send it back to the Outpsot for charging (which costs Credits)
  - Allow different settings for changing from left to right side, front or behind, rotating around the player, etc
  - Refit System
    - You have to send the upgrade parts and the turret back to base to be refitted
    - Refitting takes time, more-so depending on how much stuff you send back with it and it's current level

Bugs:
- Chainsaw icon and behavior in shop/locker is really weird for some reason
- Investigate: Unknown P-Code 721048 in script "::MonsterRegenerationHandler"
  - This is likely related to the heap corruption going on versus 32/64-bit DH-ACC builds
- Multiplayer Player health bars are not showing the fills of the proper players
- PLZ2TEST: Archvile resurrection. Test the fuck out of it.

Launcher:
- Load Order System
- Add new classes for Beta 8

Rewrites:
- Luck System, I really don't like how it's setup now with end-game luck spamming drops everywhere, do it better, maybe tier-based?
- Health Bar Script, needs to be properly redone and seperated into multiple functions
- Input Checking, should be re-written to use the generic CheckInput() method
- Shields, should just be rewritten to not suck in general
- Item and Monster Databases, for mod compatibility and allowing the creation of seperate patches outside the main library
- Locker, seperated into it's own file and split handling into functions and less repeated code
- Password System, re-write to use one hex string instead of 40+ CVARs, also rename it since Password isn't accurate anymore
- Auras, the code is becoming too inflexible for certain things such as Aura Steal
? Replace "Static" address space with a new DRPGStatic address space which references a different array (May not be necessary?)
