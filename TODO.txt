Doom RPG
- Animate items in inventory bar
- Add dynlights for DRLA:MP projectiles
- Externalize Transport voting into a Vote(str message) function (not sure how to actually accomplish this properly in ACS/DS)
- Hacky magnetize idea: when active and enemies die, pass DropItem() the TID of the killing player so the item just drops at their feet instead of the monsters
- setinventory for auras on players isn't resetting when it runs out?
- lower supply crate price, move to ammo category
- unique armors/boots shouldn't be buyable
- full health in Arena with Shield active causes gibbing
- wait until everyone is out of their menu before the next wave starts (when you start the wave)
- center restock message for shop special
- selling a shield part you have equipped spams noises

Doom RPG Launcher
- Allow multiple folders for WAD/PK3 scanning, recursively scan as well?
