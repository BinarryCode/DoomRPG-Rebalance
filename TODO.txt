Doom RPG
- Shield causing you to randomly fall over and die?
- Nuclear set bonus bug with Locker?
- Divide-by-zero in Loop script, no way to reproduce yet
- Passwords seem to be breaking a bit; Level jump occured as well as Aug Upgrades being read as Aug Canisters
- Heal Summons needs to take monster's Vitality stat into account

Re-DECORATE-ing
- Re-ID every item into a higher range (31000 perhaps?)
