Doom RPG
- Animate items in inventory bar
- Add dynlights for DRLA:MP projectiles
- Health Bars shouldn't show up when in an outpost menu
- Externalize Transport voting into a Vote(str message) function
- Hacky magnetize: when active and enemies die, pass DropItem() the TID of the killing player so the item just drops at their feet instead of the monsters
- Menu freezing and dimming should be globalized to the checking itself, not scattered everywhere that it'd actually be needed

Doom RPG Launcher
- Allow multiple folders for WAD/PK3 scanning, recursively scan as well?
