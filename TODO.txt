General
- Re-ID every item into a higher range (31000 perhaps?)
  - You can now ID stuff in MAPINFO, which would be a much better option to keep everything together and organized
- Go through and properly credit EVERYTHING (god that'll take a while)
- Co-op PIP is still not working properly
- Do some extra distance checks for FOV zoom for the faked 3D health bars? (bug SidDoyle about it, he likes mathy things)
:DONE 25/5: - Make BBS use page switching behavior similar to Shop, switching pages to switch mission difficulty, try to keep a consistant input style for all the menus
- Add more CVARs to customize the loot generator (how it calculates max items in particular, player level, player luck, map number, combinations, etc)
- Sinstorm's demon spawn cubes spawn monsters inside of walls and each other, which frankly looks silly as hell
- Event object spawning (Power column, Radiation Neutralizer) needs to be randomized so that it doesn't consistently spawn in awkward places

Post-Conversion/1.0?
- Double-check all DRLA icons, sprites, info and etc in the ItemData
- Add Utility skills similar to DRLA's skulls
  - Ditto for recall phase device
- Add a DRLA only corrupted player event, fuck you die
- Increment the charsave version since we'll need to make quite a few modifications to it for GDCC
  - Also double-check that all DRLA assembly tokens are actually saved
- Yholl's Shield Redux 3.0
  - Add new bodies, batteries and capacitors
  - Add visual effects for the shield (pulsating dynamic light, blue-aura style circle things?, etc)
  - Add Delay Rate as a stat to the menus so you can actually see it
- Shield Accessory->Augs Revamp
  - Either remove shield accessories or rename them into something else which further modifies shield stats
  - Completely rewrite the Augmentation system to support categories, multiple enabled effects, and easier to handle/read battery usage
    - Remove the current HUD widget and move its info up into the Credits/Module widget, since they will play a much more active part in-game, the battery should be visible at all times with effects active
  - Revamp and recategorize all the accessory effects into their own categories (Yholl offered to do this)
  - Make the effects more generic and not just tailored to shields (Yholl offered to do this)
  - Upgrading effects will have different benefits depending on the effect type
    - Static effects offer a few levels and change fairly drastically between upgrades
    - Scaled effects have a max level of 100 and scale their bonus slowly
    - Optimized effects have 10? levels which decrease the battery usage, but don't modify the effect at all
  - Upgrade canisters will either be scrapped or repurposed
  - Slot upgrades can only be used on a single category, which will increase the maximum effects you can have active in the specified category by 1
  - Unlocking and upgrading augs will now require a canister and a specific amount of modules
  - Some effects will only discharge battery when used or triggered, while others discharge passively while active
- Investigate why Demon Artifacts decide to take a siesta and magically dissapear off of guns
  - Seems to be an issue with character saving/loading
- Investigate the Death's Gazes artifact stunning power pissing off marines and other Outpost appliances when it's already got a check not to
- Add immunity to megabosses from the Death's Gaze death stunlock
- Get new sounds to replace a crapload of the old placeholders
  - Many skills are placeholders (Heal, Auras, etc)
  - Menu sounds are from Doom 3 and are getting real old now
    - Considering switching them to Perfect Dark sounds instead for when the GUI gets worked on
  - Individual pickup and use sounds for each health item
  - Maybe the armor types too?
  - Status effect hit and avoid sounds are just shit
  - Extra Life pickup and use sounds

  - Revamp overheat system's numbers for the addition of upgrades for it
  - Add a beam/team skill to slowly clean Toxicity from the player
- Tips browser (after GUI rewrite)
- Furious Fusion stops working every time you sell a weapon?
- Startup options are broken to shit and back for some reason
- Add strength scaling options to try and mitigate the hardcoded damage formula issues
- Add dodging and sprinting system
- Generic reward system that everything can use (Rank payout rewrite, etc)
- Barrels
  - Elemental Barrels (yoink from DRLA?)
  - Soul Capsules (rare capsules with souls in them you can break to acquire?)
- Brightmaps
  - Low Power Generator
  - Turret part crate?
  - UAC supply crate?
- DRLA HUD needs it's drawing order revised to make sure nothing is overlapping with each other
- Re-check all default settings, see how they feel, etc
- Bulk withdrawal on the weapons page with DRLA needs an extra check to prevent torgue-tier explosions from happening (runaway scripts)
- The old negative regen XP bug is back
- Add a tip that describes the shield name colors
- Controller friendliness, simplify the control scheme
  - Loaded stims could (and probably should) be inventory items like everything else - using it asks if you want to use it, drop it, or scrap it, default being use
  - Skill Wheel and Turret Wheel need to be analog-controllable (see input checking at the bottom)
- For Stat Randomization, disable manual stat increases, and give the player a fixed number of stat points for every level-up
- More easter eggs :D

Payout System
- Remove current payout system and replace with a new one:
  - Perform all kinds of different actions to earn PP (Payout Points)
  - Different options for triggering, such as time limit or level end, etc
  - In the new Payout menu, you can choose what kinds of things you'd like to use your PP on
    - XP
    - Rank
    - Credits
    - Modules
    - Turret Parts
    - Aug Set
    - Stim Packages
    - etc

Potential Future Stuff
- Add a ticker/notice display for different events (shop special item changes, rolling events, reinforcement spawns, etc)
- Add different backpacks for different things (medical backpack, bullet/shell/rocket/cell specific backpacks, stim backpack, etc)?
- Rework the way auras drop items; in particular, use the Inventory Transfer flag to make enemies drop backpacks
- New Armor System
  - Crafted either in a new menu or in a specific place in the Outpost
  - 4 Components
    - Material - Determines the durability and base damage absorption
    - Reinforcement - Adds bonus damage absorption
    - Coating - Adds additional resistances to damage types
    - Tech - Passive bonuses which the armor can give (No radius damage, etc)

Minigames
- Slot Machine

- Blackjack

Portable Turret System
- Empty crates should be omitted from the crate sensor beam iteration
  - Add a FindCrate() function which takes a TID and returns the found crate with that TID to help with this
- [KS] Pathfinding

LegenDoom Compatibility
- Make it so when the weapon info page is up, HUD elements are hidden
- Find all the prefixes that are broken, don't work, or are mechanically incorrect

Launcher
- Load Order System

Rewrites/Reorganization
- GUI System, Finish the GUI library and move all menu and related things to using it
- Input Checking, should be re-written to use the generic CheckInput() method
- More utility function for repetitive menial shit (InMenu(), etc)
- Arena System to support seperate arena maps and their own self-contained scripting
? Databases, for mod compatibility and allowing the creation of separate patches outside the main library


Mission page, show list of current events so you don't have to cycle through each map


Reported Bugs:

1. Summons always attack the Force Wall object, despite that they can't destroy it except Arch-viles.
2. Whenever allied Arch-viles ressurect enemy they becomes allied too, but their auras acts versus you.
4. Very often level is de-facto completely cleared - all enemies are killed and map tracker confirmed this, but map statistic shows opposite something like 87\91 kills. I think that probably may be due some few The Hungry stucked into the walls or another objects, but i didn't heared ever their featured hungry-buzzing sounds in that case. That very annoying and can't allows make 100% map kills.
5. Occasionally I have been locked in the map with Megaboss event due... his missing on the map. Forex, I arrive to the map04 (Focus) of Doom 2 with megaboss event but whole level was absolutely uninhabited. I know that megabosses can tele-wandering while idle but I many times explore a level with a map tracker. I tried to re-generate map by traveling to Outpost and back but with no result. Later, I finish a previous level and meet the Pride at last.
6. Dark zone and especially Acid rain events massively slowdown the game. Yeah, i know that problem has been reported by another users earlier so it's just reminder.
Whenever I quickly step into a fast fading tele-point at Hellstorm Elemental death place in outpost Arena, I suddenly has been teleported to the strange small blue room with a tons of good loot and lonely exit teleporter. - Exploitable? 
(Actually DRLA related, but megahealth on outpost level allows this to happen)
Character loading doesn't erase the current character beforehand, and can be exploited
Also defused bomb explosion don't execute assasination mission as completed normally: crappy drop and no reward. Looks like a game mechanic consider bomb as a killer actor (with no luck ofc), but not a player. In my subject opinion that's fairly because nuke-ppwning is incredibly easy way (ofc if you are managed to defuse bomb earlier) to kill a some scumbag without any struggle, but it's still seems like a bug anyway.
Nuclear Power Armor set doesn't protect you from radiation after the nuke explosion (DRPG_DRLA) while protection from toxic areas does work.
Various items are being crushed that shouldn't - credits, shop cards. Modules appear immune

retrieve all from locker caused a lockup on MP for a client
unequpping a shield eccessory that isn't equipped tries to run script 0

Nuclear bomb event hud not removed on next map if you escape rather than defuse.

3) This would result in a balance change, but discount for leveling a stat that's partway there from use?

As for the question of stats and skills using the same resource pool, I've been thinking it might make more sense for any of the non-free skills to actually require a certain level in the stat that governs the skills, or maybe just every one point you put into it also lets you put one point into skills (with skills having increasing costs per level). This increases the value of focusing on being a "mage" type, by rewarding you more for points invested, while also meaning you can't just cherry-pick the a few skills like invulnerability (which you'd probably give a fairly high prerequisite). Hell, certain *pages* of skills could be unlocked at certain thresholds, much like the luck stat works. Summoning at 25, or whatever.

As for the shop: The one thing I've *always* wanted is being able to set amounts. Like "I want to keep 3 on me, 10 in storage, and sell any beyond that" so that if I have 3, it deposits. If there's 10 in my locker already, then it sells. Auto-withdraw if I go below 3 *would* be nice, or even auto-purchase, but those significantly affect balance, and I figure if things like that were to be automated, it'd have to be more expensive in energy to send them, and more expensive in credits to auto-purchase as opposed to manually. But being able to auto-purchase bullets at say... double the normal cost? Something I'd absolutely do.
