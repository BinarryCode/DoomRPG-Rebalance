TODO:
- Update DRLA stuff for DRLA Beta 8/Monster Pack Beta 5
- Re-ID every item into a higher range (31000 perhaps?)
- Shop and Locker systems need to handle set bonuses properly, specifically in a called function
- Move Powerup HUD timers from SBARINFO into a HUD script
- Defense stat needs a curve, more points put in at the beginning give more defense
- Luck needs a bit of a nerfing, maybe it needs some sort of curve?
- Hell Unleashed needs monster threat checks against average player level
- Item Roulette has a weird bug with EnterOutpost, likely corruption somewhere?
- Change *_ID's in Defs to actually use our macro to generate HudMessage ID's
- Character save checksumming is horribly broken for god knows what reason
- Maps such as E1M8 and MAP07 with tag 666/667 usage do not work properly
- Health Bar accents, instead of drawing the aura circles, layer accents representing each aura type on the bar's graphic itself
  - Strength = Flames
  - Defense = Metallic/Plated look?
  - Potency = Sparkles?
  - Vitality = Plusses/Hearts?
  - Energy = Orbs/swishy electricity?
  - Regeneration = Up arrows?
  - Agility = Some sort of swooshy wind after-imagey thing?
  - Capacity = Some sort of large rifled bullet or slug?
  - Luck = Dollar Signs or C's or something?
  - Shadow = Engulfed in shadowy mistyness?
- New Sounds
  - IKU-N7 Shield Accessory
- Minigames
  - Item Roulette
    - Allow variable amount of chips to be used to
      - Amount of items in the roulette
      - Reduce chances of duds
      - Item Quality
  - Slot Machine
  - Blackjack
  - Hacking
- Map Events System
  - Get a reward using GetRewardItem() when completing an event
- Portable Turret System
  - Separate level and stats system
  - Create upgrade items (Seryder says he'll make a sprite for me)
  - Give different Upgrade items to boost it's stats
  - Make stats persistent between levels
  - Quick Menu with pages for Stats, Upgrades, position, etc
  - Battery powered, you need to either give it Augmentation batteries or send it back to the Outpost for charging (which costs Credits)
  - Allow different settings for changing from left to right side, front or behind, rotating around the player (orbit upgrade), etc
  - Turret's Capacity and Luck will affect the monster drops of it's kills
  - Ammo must be loaded manually into the turret, user-selectable which ammo the turret uses, ammo determines the type of attack
    - Clips = Basic high-speed hitscan attacks
    - Shells = Slower, pellet-spread attacks
    - Rockets = Rockets
    - Plasma = Plasma
  - Upgrades will cost turret upgrade parts, many will have multiple levels, costing more to acquire each level
    - Damage upgrades
      - Clip = Rate of fire increase
      - Shells = Amount of pellets increase
      - Rockets = Projectile Speed, firing cooldown speed, seeking
      - Plasma = Projectile Speed, bursts (max out at full-auto?), seeking
    - Ammo upgrades
      - Maximum held Ammo capacities
      - Nuclear ammo generation, more points means quicker ammo generation
    - Shielding from different damage types (in 5% upgrade increments up to 50% max)
    - Battery improvements
      - Max battery charge
      - Lower battery consumption
    - Auto-Injector
      - Injects you with either Stat stims or Powerup stims
      - Higher level gives more/higher rolls on what you might get
      - Only stat stims at first levels, adds Powerup stims at higher levels
    - Guided Rocket System
    - Orbiting
    - Full angular control (turret will rotate around and fire at everything, not be forced to follow your facing angle, togglable?)
  - Refit System
    - You have to send the upgrade parts and the turret back to base to be refitted
    - Refitting takes time, more-so depending on how much stuff you send back with it and it's current level

Launcher:
- Load Order System
- Add new classes for Beta 8

Rewrites/Reorganization:
- Integer Math, use it in places where fixed accuracy isn't necessary because ZDoom doesn't know how to round or math properly
- Arena, Detach Arena's reliance from Outpost so that it can work self-contained on it's own map and generally clean it up to be less insane and crap
- Defs, clean up some inconsistent naming and move some magic numbers to enums which aren't using them yet
- Menu System, instead of using giant functions, use function pointers and structs, etc
- Input Checking, should be re-written to use the generic CheckInput() method
- Databases, for mod compatibility and allowing the creation of separate patches outside the main library
- Token Converter, it's just flat-out megabroke
? Replace "Static" address space with a new DRPGStatic address space which references a different array (May not be necessary?)
