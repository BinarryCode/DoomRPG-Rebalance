Doom RPG
- Finish adding sprite data for DRLA items into ItemData

Potentially Fixed
- Shield causing you to randomly fall over and die?
- Nuclear set bonus bug with Locker?
- Divide-by-zero in Loop script, no way to reproduce yet

Re-DECORATE-ing
- Re-ID every item into a higher range (31000 perhaps?)
