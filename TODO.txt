Doom RPG
- Re-ID every item into a higher range (31000 perhaps?)
- DRLA Sets involving weapons can bug out if you deposit them in the Locker
- Practice target is broken AGAIN
- Clean up headers some more
- Mission BBS
- Indestructible Stim is broken
- Add learned exotic assembly effects to Password System when using DRLA
- Soul Steal is missing a use sound
- <Ryan_Cordell> hey Kyle873, any chance for run + up/down toggling the next page for that specific item group?
- <Kate> hmm, Kyle873, soul steal on aura'd enemies should drop the corresponding soul instead of a random one, so if you bother to find an enemy with an aura to use it on, it doesn't go to total waste
