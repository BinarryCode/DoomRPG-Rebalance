TODO:
- Re-ID every item into a higher range (31000 perhaps?)
- Add learned exotic assembly effects to Password System when using DRLA
- Shop and Locker systems need to handle set bonuses properly, specifically in a called function
- Update item icons for DRLA to use new icons, specifically demolition ammo weapons

Bugs:
- Spider Mastermind Hell spawn is broken
- Chainsaw icon and behavior in shop/locker is really weird for some reason
- Investigate: Unknown P-Code 721048 in script "::MonsterRegenerationHandler"
- Multiplayer Player health bars are not showing the fills of the proper players
- Archvile resurrection is broken.
  See: https://github.com/Kyle873/DoomRPG/blob/d678e7d9ab4e2da88e47243c7963f70b95f7f59b/DoomRPG/scripts/Monsters.ds#L1206
  Basically, their ID gets unassigned when they die so that other monsters can re-use it. This assumes a monster will never
  need their ID again when they die, because they will be reassigned a new one when they resurrect.
  This is currently not the case, which is problematic.

Launcher:
- Load Order System

Rewrites:
- Health Bar Script, needs to be properly redone and seperated into multiple functions
- Input Checking, should be re-written to use the generic CheckInput() method
- Shields, should just be rewritten to not suck in general
- Item and Monster Databases, for mod compatibility and allowing the creation of seperate patches outside the main library
- Locker, seperated into it's own file and split handling into functions and less repeated code
- Password System, re-write to use one hex string instead of 40+ CVARs, also rename it since Password isn't accurate anymore
? Replace "Static" address space with a new DRPGStatic address space which references a different array (May not be necessary?)
