General
- Re-ID every item into a higher range (31000 perhaps?)
- Go through and properly credit EVERYTHING (god that'll take a while)
- Item Roulette has a weird bug with EnterOutpost, likely corruption somewhere? (WHY WON'T ENTEROUTPOST JUST DIE FJELFHWIUGHUIWG)
- Character save checksumming is horribly broken for god knows what reason
- High level arena and reinforcements need to change, are currently just vile spam
- Rewards list needs to be generated per-game, not per-map
- Co-op PIP is still not working properly
- Update/add learned assemblies/modpacks in charsaving
- Need to add the Demolitionist to the main menu display (walking animation thingy)
- Used stim injectors are discarded behind you like empty credit chips
  - Was actually thinking of just using rotsprite to create 8 flying frames for both the used injector and also the blank credit chip for when they're tossed for extra prettyness factor
- Do some extra distance checks for chasecam and FOV zooms for the faked 3D health bars? (bug SidDoyle about it, he likes mathy things)
- Create accumulators for the Combo Meter and Credits HUD
- Add different backpacks for different things (medical backpack, bullet/shell/rocket/cell specific backpacks, stim backpack, etc)?
- Crate firewall/locked items minigame stuff
- Using time sphere before stim causes powerup stim effects to not apply immediately?
- Use TEXTURES to create inventory bar graphics instead of duplicating sprites everywhere
- If the double-damage thing from the Environmental Hazard event re-occurs, bump Edward850 about it

Health Bar accents - instead of drawing the aura circles, layer accents representing each aura type on the bar's graphic itself
  - Strength - Flames
  - Defense - Metallic/Plated look?
  - Potency - Sparkles?
  - Vitality - Plusses/Hearts?
  - Energy - Orbs/swishy electricity?
  - Regeneration - Up arrows?
  - Agility - Some sort of swooshy wind after-imagey thing?
  - Capacity - Some sort of large rifled bullet or slug?
  - Luck - Dollar Signs or C's or something?
  - Shadow - Engulfed in shadowy mistyness?

Minigames
  - Item Roulette
    - Allow variable amount of chips to be used to
      - Adjust the amount of items in the roulette
      - Reduce chances of duds
      - Item Quality
  - Slot Machine
  - Blackjack
  - Hacking

Map Events System
  - End conditions for removing certain events from the map
    - Toxic Hazard
  - Allow you to pick up the nuke when it's disarmed and drop it again for maximum room clearing boom

Portable Turret System
  - Battery powered, you need to either give it Augmentation batteries or send it back to the Outpost for charging (which costs Credits), or have generator upgrades to let it charge itself
  - Allow different settings for changing from left to right side, front or behind, rotating around the player (orbit upgrade), etc
  - Ammo must be loaded manually into the turret, user-selectable which ammo the turret uses, ammo determines the type of attack
  - Upgrades will cost turret parts, many will have multiple levels, costing more to acquire each level
  - Refit System
    - You have to send the upgrade parts and the turret back to base to be refitted
    - Refitting and repairing takes time, more-so depending on how much stuff you send back with it and it's current level

New Armor System
- Crafted either in a new menu or in a specific place in the Outpost
- 4 Components
  - Material - Determines the durability
  - Reinforcement - Determines the damage absorption
  - Coating - Adds additional resistances to damage types
  - Tech - Passive bonuses which the armor can give (No radius damage, etc)

Launcher
- Load Order System
- Add new classes for Beta 8

Rewrites/Reorganization
- GDCC, Rewrite the codebase to use the GDCC compiler (RIP me)
- GUI System, Finish the GUI library and move all menu and related things to using it
- Integer Math, use it in places where fixed accuracy isn't necessary because ZDoom doesn't know how to round or math properly
- Input Checking, should be re-written to use the generic CheckInput() method
- More utility function for repetitive menial shit (InMenu(), etc)
? Databases, for mod compatibility and allowing the creation of separate patches outside the main library
? Replace "Static" address space with a new DRPGStatic address space which references a different array (May not be necessary?)
