Doom RPG
- DRLA Sets involving weapons can bug out if you deposit them in the Locker
- Re-ID every item into a higher range (31000 perhaps?)
- Make an enum for ItemData categories

- Re-write monster scripts
  -> Add staggering at the beginning of the Monster-related loop scripts
    -> Implement by modulating the table index (Delay(ID % 4))
  -> Weaken skill will likely need a rewrite
  -> Player damage numbers will need to read the height directly from the player
