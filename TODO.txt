TODO:
- Re-ID every item into a higher range (31000 perhaps?)
- Go through and properly credit EVERYTHING (god that'll take a while)
- Item Roulette has a weird bug with EnterOutpost, likely corruption somewhere? (WHY WON'T ENTEROUTPOST JUST DIE FJELFHWIUGHUIWG)
- Character save checksumming is horribly broken for god knows what reason
- High level arena and reinforcements need to change, are currently just vile spam
- Have regen scale based on percentage of the monsters health or something
- Standing in range of someone else's aura when it ends does not end it for you and keeps it semi-permanently
- Soulspheres are giving negative Vitality XP?
- Save Stat XP in character saving
- Health Bar accents, instead of drawing the aura circles, layer accents representing each aura type on the bar's graphic itself

    <Yholl> Well, basically, I was thinking that at the start of the level, there's some sort of demonic altar or something, If you activate it, it starts the event
    <Yholl> You can't leave without activating it, but you can go through the level and get ready to dash through without getting ruined
    <Yholl> Open Pandora's Box
    <Kyle873> a big white light flies out of it and faderanges the entire screen white
    <Yholl> Is it possible to replace a sky on the fly? If it works, could use that
    <Yholl> Make a cool red sky that spins rapidly
    <Kyle873> [...] basically trying to spawn it near the player with sin/cos and moving it a bit if it can't spawn, rinse and repeat until a successful spawn, if that fails, increase radius, repeat
  - End conditions for removing certain events from the map (disarming bomb, purging radiation, etc)
  - Get a reward using GetRewardItem() when completing an event
- Portable Turret System
  - Separate level and stats system
  - Create upgrade items
  - Give different Upgrade items to boost it's stats
  - Make stats persistent between levels
  - Quick Menu with pages for Stats, Upgrades, position, etc
  - Battery powered, you need to either give it Augmentation batteries or send it back to the Outpost for charging (which costs Credits)
  - Allow different settings for changing from left to right side, front or behind, rotating around the player (orbit upgrade), etc
  - Turret's Capacity and Luck will affect the monster drops of it's kills
  - Ammo must be loaded manually into the turret, user-selectable which ammo the turret uses, ammo determines the type of attack
    - Clips = Basic high-speed hitscan attacks
    - Shells = Slower, pellet-spread attacks
    - Rockets = Rockets
    - Plasma = Plasma
    - Some sort of railgun piercing shot of death? Maybe create a special pickup/ammo type just for it that can sometimes spawn in place of normal ammo?
  - Upgrades will cost turret upgrade parts, many will have multiple levels, costing more to acquire each level
    - Damage upgrades
      - Clip = Rate of fire increase
      - Shells = Amount of pellets increase
      - Rockets = Projectile Speed, firing cooldown speed, seeking
      - Plasma = Projectile Speed, bursts (max out at full-auto?), seeking
      - Railgun = Burst shots, piercing ability?
    - Ammo upgrades
      - Maximum held Ammo capacities
      - Nano ammo generation, more points means quicker ammo generation
    - Shielding from different damage types (in 5% upgrade increments up to 50% max)
    - Battery improvements
      - Max battery charge
      - Lower battery consumption
    - Auto-Injector
      - Injects you with either Stat stims or Powerup stims
      - Higher level gives more/higher rolls on what you might get
      - Only stat stims at first levels, adds Powerup stims at higher levels
    - Guided Rocket System
    - Orbiting
    - Full angular control (turret will rotate around and fire at everything, not be forced to follow your facing angle, togglable?)
  - Refit System
    - You have to send the upgrade parts and the turret back to base to be refitted
    - Refitting takes time, more-so depending on how much stuff you send back with it and it's current level

Launcher:
- Load Order System
- Add new classes for Beta 8

Rewrites/Reorganization:
- GDCC, oh god...
- Integer Math, use it in places where fixed accuracy isn't necessary because ZDoom doesn't know how to round or math properly
- Defs, clean up some inconsistent naming and move some magic numbers to enums which aren't using them yet
- Menu System, instead of using giant functions, use function pointers and structs, etc
- Input Checking, should be re-written to use the generic CheckInput() method
? Databases, for mod compatibility and allowing the creation of separate patches outside the main library
? Replace "Static" address space with a new DRPGStatic address space which references a different array (May not be necessary?)
