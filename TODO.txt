General
- Re-ID every item into a higher range (31000 perhaps?)
  - You can now ID stuff in MAPINFO, which would be a much better option to keep everything together and organized
- Go through and properly credit EVERYTHING (god that'll take a while)
- A lot of map namespace stuff needs to not use map namespaces
- Co-op PIP is still not working properly
- Do some extra distance checks for FOV zoom for the faked 3D health bars? (bug SidDoyle about it, he likes mathy things)
- Make BBS use page switching behavior similar to Shop, switching pages to switch mission difficulty, try to keep a consistant input style for all the menus
- Add more CVARs to customize the loot generator (how it calculates max items in particular, player level, player luck, map number, combinations, etc)

Pay System
- Remove current payout system and replace with a new one:
  - Pays out XP, Rank, Credits, Modules and potentially turret parts as well as a random item (like missions)
  - Set the default timer to 10 minutes instead of 5
- Keep track of many different things to bring them into equations for calculating payout rewards:
  - Damage Taken
  - Health Current, Max
  - Armor Current, Max
  - Shield Current, Max
  - Level-ups
  - Rank-ups
  - Kills
  - Missions Completed
  - Levels Completed
  - ...  

Potential Future Stuff
- Add a ticker/notice display for different events (shop special item changes, rolling events, reinforcement spawns, etc)
- Add different backpacks for different things (medical backpack, bullet/shell/rocket/cell specific backpacks, stim backpack, etc)?
- New Armor System
  - Crafted either in a new menu or in a specific place in the Outpost
  - 4 Components
    - Material - Determines the durability and base damage absorption
    - Reinforcement - Adds bonus damage absorption
    - Coating - Adds additional resistances to damage types
    - Tech - Passive bonuses which the armor can give (No radius damage, etc)

Minigames
- Slot Machine
  - Kate wants to do this
- Blackjack

Portable Turret System
- Empty crates should be omitted from the crate sensor beam iteration
  - Add a FindCrate() function which takes a TID and returns the found crate with that TID to help with this
- [KS] Pathfinding

Launcher
- Load Order System
- Add new class for DRLA 1.0 (Demolitionist)

Rewrites/Reorganization
- GDCC, Rewrite the codebase to use the GDCC compiler (RIP me)
- GUI System, Finish the GUI library and move all menu and related things to using it
- Input Checking, should be re-written to use the generic CheckInput() method
- More utility function for repetitive menial shit (InMenu(), etc)
? Databases, for mod compatibility and allowing the creation of separate patches outside the main library
