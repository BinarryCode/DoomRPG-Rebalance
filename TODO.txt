General
- Re-ID every item into a higher range (31000 perhaps?)
- Go through and properly credit EVERYTHING (god that'll take a while)
- Item Roulette has a weird bug with EnterOutpost, likely corruption somewhere? (WHY WON'T ENTEROUTPOST JUST DIE FJELFHWIUGHUIWG)
- Character save checksumming is horribly broken for god knows what reason
- High level arena and reinforcements need to change, are currently just vile spam
- Rewards list needs to be generated per-game, not per-map
- Make keys shared between players in multiplayer
- Hide monsters/item/secrets counts in the Outpost
- Leveling stats past 100 with stat tokens while using natural stat leveling is broken

Health Bar accents - instead of drawing the aura circles, layer accents representing each aura type on the bar's graphic itself
  - Strength - Flames
  - Defense - Metallic/Plated look?
  - Potency - Sparkles?
  - Vitality - Plusses/Hearts?
  - Energy - Orbs/swishy electricity?
  - Regeneration - Up arrows?
  - Agility - Some sort of swooshy wind after-imagey thing?
  - Capacity - Some sort of large rifled bullet or slug?
  - Luck - Dollar Signs or C's or something?
  - Shadow - Engulfed in shadowy mistyness?

Minigames
  - Item Roulette
    - Allow variable amount of chips to be used to
      - Adjust the amount of items in the roulette
      - Reduce chances of duds
      - Item Quality
  - Slot Machine
  - Blackjack
  - Hacking

Map Events System
  - End conditions for removing certain events from the map

Portable Turret System
  - Battery powered, you need to either give it Augmentation batteries or send it back to the Outpost for charging (which costs Credits), or have generator upgrades to let it charge itself
  - Allow different settings for changing from left to right side, front or behind, rotating around the player (orbit upgrade), etc
  - Ammo must be loaded manually into the turret, user-selectable which ammo the turret uses, ammo determines the type of attack
  - Upgrades will cost turret parts, many will have multiple levels, costing more to acquire each level
  - Refit System
    - You have to send the upgrade parts and the turret back to base to be refitted
    - Refitting and repairing takes time, more-so depending on how much stuff you send back with it and it's current level

Launcher
- Load Order System
- Add new classes for Beta 8

Rewrites/Reorganization
- GDCC, Rewrite the codebase to use the GDCC compiler (RIP me)
- GUI System - Finish the GUI library and move all menu and related things to using it
- Integer Math, use it in places where fixed accuracy isn't necessary because ZDoom doesn't know how to round or math properly
- Input Checking, should be re-written to use the generic CheckInput() method
? Databases, for mod compatibility and allowing the creation of separate patches outside the main library
? Replace "Static" address space with a new DRPGStatic address space which references a different array (May not be necessary?)
