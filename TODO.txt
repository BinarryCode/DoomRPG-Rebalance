TODO:
- Re-ID every item into a higher range (31000 perhaps?)
- Add learned exotic assembly effects to Password System when using DRLA

Bugs:
- Practice target is broken AGAIN
- Shadow Aura enemies are being affected by time freeze but shouldn't be
- Player's damage numbers are appearing at their feet

Rewrites:
- Health Bar Script, needs to be properly redone and seperated into multiple functions
- Input Checking, should be re-written to use the generic CheckInput() method
- Shields, should just be rewritten to not suck in general
- Item and Monster Databases, for mod compatibility and allowing the creation of seperate patches outside the main library
- Locker, seperated into it's own file and split handling into functions and less repeated code
- Password System, re-write to use one hex string instead of 40+ CVARs, also rename it since Password isn't accurate anymore
