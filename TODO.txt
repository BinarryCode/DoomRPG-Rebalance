Doom RPG
- DRLA Sets involving weapons can bug out if you deposit them in the Locker
- Finish animating weapons/armors for DRLA item grids
- Re-work formulas for calculating Shield Part prices
- Change HealthBonus to inherit CustomInventory
- Buying ammo in DRLA is dropping modpacks/pistols again
- Re-ID every item into a higher range (31000 perhaps?)
- Sometimes shadow aura enemies are turning completely invisible for some reason
- Threat calculations broken on Powersuits
- Powersuits should destroy Immunity Crsytals
