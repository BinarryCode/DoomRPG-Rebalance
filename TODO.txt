TODO:
- Re-ID every item into a higher range (31000 perhaps?)
- Add learned exotic assembly effects to Password System when using DRLA

Bugs:
- The damage/health loss system needs to do all of its' business with status effects, toxicity, and hud displays in a single function, because otherwise gaining health, like through the assembler healer, or taking un-typed damage, triggers the damage system to give the player a giant middle finger
- Continue number on icon seems off (too far to the left maybe?)

Launcher:
- Load Order System

Rewrites:
- Health Bar Script, needs to be properly redone and seperated into multiple functions
- Input Checking, should be re-written to use the generic CheckInput() method
- Shields, should just be rewritten to not suck in general
- Item and Monster Databases, for mod compatibility and allowing the creation of seperate patches outside the main library
- Locker, seperated into it's own file and split handling into functions and less repeated code
- Password System, re-write to use one hex string instead of 40+ CVARs, also rename it since Password isn't accurate anymore

Things for Kate to do:
- Replace "Static" address space with a new DRPGStatic address space which references a different array
- Allow LibDS to exist outside of DRPG rather than statically compiling it (requires new address space, see above)
