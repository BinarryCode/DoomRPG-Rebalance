General
- Re-ID every item into a higher range (31000 perhaps?)
  - You can now ID stuff in MAPINFO, which would be a much better option to keep everything together and organized
- Go through and properly credit EVERYTHING (god that'll take a while)
- Character save checksumming is horribly broken for god knows what reason
- Rewards list needs to be generated per-game, not per-map
  - A lot of map namespace stuff needs to not use map namespaces; items is just one example
- Co-op PIP is still not working properly
- Do some extra distance checks for FOV zoom for the faked 3D health bars? (bug SidDoyle about it, he likes mathy things)

Potential Future Stuff
- Add a ticker/notice display for different events (shop special item changes, rolling events, reinforcement spawns, etc)
- Add different backpacks for different things (medical backpack, bullet/shell/rocket/cell specific backpacks, stim backpack, etc)?
- New Armor System
  - Crafted either in a new menu or in a specific place in the Outpost
  - 4 Components
    - Material - Determines the durability and base damage absorption
    - Reinforcement - Adds bonus damage absorption
    - Coating - Adds additional resistances to damage types
    - Tech - Passive bonuses which the armor can give (No radius damage, etc)

Minigames
- Slot Machine
  - Kate wants to do this
- Blackjack

Map Events System
- Create a more generic reward system for completing events
- Events need to not "complete" immediately, instead delay until the exit is
  triggered, so that One-Monster doesn't award a kill bonus when it unsets
  itself
- Revamp the Low Power event into a techno-junkyard where stuff like the broken
  turrets live
  - Possibly include some other broken junk that can give credits, batteries,
    ammo, etc. when shot apart, or can be sold
- Figure out a better gimmick for Environmental Hazard, give the player a reason
  to want to power the generator and finish the event

Portable Turret System
- Empty crates should be omitted from the crate sensor beam iteration
  - Add a FindCrate() function which takes a TID and returns the found crate with that TID to help with this
- Command Modules
  - Re-designate them. Current design might instead be:
    - Hold Position: The turret stays mostly stationary in one spot. If enemies
      come into range, it will fight them off, so it can be told to guard an
      entrance this way.
    - Cover Fire: The turret will actively attempt to distract enemies by
      shooting them, then luring them away from the player. If successful, it
      will engage in battle on its' own. If it dispatches the enemy or gets low
      on health, it will stop providing cover and return to the player.
    - Return: Cancels any previous commands given, clears target. Giving this
      command also immediately teleports the turret to you, so you can use it to
      recall a lost turret.

Launcher
- Load Order System
- Add new classes for Beta 8

Rewrites/Reorganization
- GDCC, Rewrite the codebase to use the GDCC compiler (RIP me)
- GUI System, Finish the GUI library and move all menu and related things to using it
- Input Checking, should be re-written to use the generic CheckInput() method
- More utility function for repetitive menial shit (InMenu(), etc)
? Databases, for mod compatibility and allowing the creation of separate patches outside the main library
