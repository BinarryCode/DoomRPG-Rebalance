How to make a map compatible with DRPGs arena system (rough, UDMF only).

Instead of placing monster spawns, you must use Map Spots with a starting TID of 1100. For each map spot be sure to increment the TID or you will get duplicate monster spawns.

Map exits. These are automatically handled via DRPGs exit script. Just place exits as normal.

Arena map events.
- Updates soon.

Lastly you must have a means of activating the arena which requires calling two separate scripts.
The first script must be repeatable and ensures that all players are ready. I recommend having this as a crossable line.
The second script must not be repeatable and starts the arena. I recommend having this as a crossable line.
They must not be called both at once. Both means of activation must be separate. 

Below is ready to use ACS for your map.

#include "zcommon.acs"

// Enable/Disable the Arena
script 1 (void)
{
    ACS_NamedExecute("ToggleArena", 0);
}

// Passed the Arena line
script 2 (void)
{
    ACS_NamedExecute("PassArenaLine", 0);
}
