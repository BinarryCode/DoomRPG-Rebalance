## Fork overview

DoomRPG and DoomRLA contain a lot of content which can be enough for the passage of several WADs in a row. However, the original versions of these modifications give players most of the content in a short period of time, which is why the player does not have time to feel the depth of the possibilities of DoomRPG and DoomRLA.

This fork intends to solve this problem. Now the content is served to the player as you progress through the levels (maps), increase the level of the character and the level of luck (a little hint: I recommend paying special attention to this parameter).

In addition, some of the content (RPG's Skills, Stims, AUG, Auras, etc.) are now the things that need to be applied to survive. Especially good Stims when meeting with boss - remember this.

Among other things, the Adaptive difficulty mode (DoomRLA's stuff) was revised. Changed the intensity of the appearance of more complex monsters on the levels. In addition, you will be able to adjust it. Just go to DoomRPG Options -> DoomRLA Monster Pack Options and see for yourself (default is 8).

Enjoy! 

## Manual Installing

- GZDoom v4.7.0 ([v4.7.0](https://zdoom.org/files/gzdoom/bin/gzdoom-4-7-0-Windows-64bit.zip) recommended) or higher is required to play this mod.
- LZDoom v3.83a or higher.
- Delta Touch (Android) v3.1 or higher (includes the above versions or higher).

To run the mod I recommend using [Doom RPG SE Launcher 1.0.3](https://github.com/Forevener/DRPGSEL/releases/tag/v1.0.3) (no higher).

After installation be sure to DoomRPG settings reset (Options -> DoomRPG Otions -> Reset to defaults).

Use the following load order:

1. [The Sentinel's Lexicon - PvE mapset Compilaition](https://github.com/WNC12k/DoomRPG-Lexicon/releases) (recommended);
2. [WadSmoosh](https://github.com/WNC12k/DoomRPG-WadSmoosh/releases) (recommended);

## Installing (build)

I wanted to share my build. Perhaps someone can use it to run a Doom RPG.

Below is the download link:
1. [DoomRPG SE Rebalance 1.27a (for GZDoom 4.7.1)](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1lbhGQVh_MXSTBQ-iCmuOIHOE31HREPUE?usp=sharing)

Installation Instructions:

1. The archive has a folder DoomRPG SE Rebalance. I recommend placing it at the following address: "D:\Games\DoomRPG SE Rebalance".
2. In case you want to place the folder in a place of your choice, you will have to change the corresponding addresses in the DoomRPG Launcher.
3. The archive has a folder Extras, it has screenshots of DoomRPG Launcher with the order of launching modifications (DoomRL, Lexicon, etc.). Bring it in line with the screenshots in DoomRPG Launcher.
4. Launch the game via the DoomRPG Launcher and exit. The game will create a configuration file at "D:\Games\DoomRPG SE Rebalance\ports\(G)ZDooM 4.7.1\gzdoom-username.ini".
5. Now you need to take the configuration file from the archive in the Extras folder and replace it with the file from step "3". Note that you need to change the "username" in the file name.
6. Please note that the configuration file has also made some changes that affect the functioning of the assembly. Therefore, I recommend using this file as a base. Also note that in the DoomRL Arsenal settings, perks are turned off and the option to learn recipes is enabled. If you are against such settings, disable them manually in the Options menu.
7. Run the game through the DoomRPG Launcher and play.

Please note that for those who like to play on Gamepad, there are 2 optional files:
1. Gamepad Control Helper (author - Me);
2. Aim Assist 0.75 (author - RicardoLuis0).
