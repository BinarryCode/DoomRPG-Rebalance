TIPS
----
- You can Overdrive a skill by holding the run button. Doing this will always use the skill, regardless of it's Energy cost. However, this will bring your current Energy into the negatives. When negative, you will suffer stat penalties and not be able to use any skills until your Energy is restored past 0.
- Overdriving an unlearnt skill will automatically use an available Skill Token to learn it.
- You can Respec (reset your stats and skills) from the Doom RPG Options menu. Respecs will cost you half of your total Credits.
- You can change the current skill level by using the computer across from the regeneration chambers at the UAC Outpost.
- You can convert between Stat, Stat Cap and Skill Tokens using the computer to the right of the Skill Computer
